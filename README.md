### Hi there 👋

I'm Valentin, 28, and currently live in the beautiful city of **Lille, France**.

I have worked for several years as a **Full-Stack Web Developer**, sometimes focusing on the backend part and others on the frontend one. In the end, I found interest in working on both, owning on a feature from A to Z instead of focusing on one aspect.

Today I work at **Algolia**, that I primarly joined as a **Solution Engineer**, helping our customers to integrate Algolia's features into their platforms. Since June '19, I continued as **Software Engineer**, working on Algolia's Dashboard, used by more than 9,000 customers.

You can contact me at valentin@hey.com, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valentindotxyz) or on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/valentindotxyz).

Oh and by the way, I'm also part of the [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com) Community 🏳️‍🌈.
