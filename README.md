### Hi there 👋

I'm Valentin, 27, and currently live in the beautiful city of **Lille, France**.

I have worked for several years as a **full-stack web developer**, sometimes focusing on the backend part and others on the frontend one. In the end, I found interest in working on both, owning on a feature from A to Z instead of focusing on one aspect in particular.

Today I work at **Algolia**, that I joined as a **Solution Engineer**, to help our customers integrating Algolia's features into their platforms. I'm now back on the Engineering side as a **Software Engineer**, working on Algolia's Dashboard, used by more than 9,000 customers.

At the end of the day, **I'm looking to be part of something meaningful that gives me a sense of accomplishment**–the more people it helps and reaches, the better.

You can contact me at valentin@hey.com or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valentindotxyz) and [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/valentindotxyz).

Oh, and by the way, I'm also part of [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com) 🏳️‍🌈.
