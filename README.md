### Hi there 👋

I'm Valentin, 28, and currently live in the beautiful city of **Lille, France**.

I have worked for several years as a **full-stack web developer**, sometimes focusing on the backend part and others on the frontend one. In the end, I found interest in working on both, owning on a feature from A to Z instead of focusing on one aspect.

Today I work at **Algolia**, that I primarly joined as a **Solution Engineer**, to help our customers integrating Algolia's features into their platforms. Since June '19, continued as a **Software Engineer**, working on Algolia's Dashboard, used by more than 9,000 customers.

Oh, and by the way, I'm also part of the [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com) Community 🏳️‍🌈.
