### Hi there 👋

I'm Valentin, full-stack web developer.

Today, I work at Algolia that I joined in 2018 as a Solutions Engineer to help our customers integrate Algolia's features into their platforms. Since 2019, I got back to Engineering as a Senior Software Engineer in the Dashboard team, used by more than 10,000 customers worldwide.

With a product mindset, I don't see coding as an end in itself — rather a mean to bring solutions to a broader problem that needs to be solved.

I'm also part of the [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com) Community 🏳️‍🌈.
