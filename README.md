### Hello, World! 👋

I'm Valentin, full-stack web developer based in Paris, France.

Today, I work at Cloudflare as Frontend Engineer—currently ramping up in my new role as I joined the company in June ‘22!

Previously, I worked at Algolia that I joined in 2018, first as a Solutions Engineer to help customers integrate Algolia's features into their platforms. Then, with a strong technical background, as Software Engineer in the Algolia Dashboard team, used by more than 12,000 customers worldwide.

With a product mindset, I don't see coding as an end in itself—rather a mean to bring solutions to problems worth solving.
