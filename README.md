### Hi there 👋

I'm Valentin, full-stack web developer.

Today I work at Algolia that I joined in June 2018 as a Solutions Engineer to help our customers integrate Algolia's features into their platforms. Since June 2019, I got back to the R&D track as a Software Engineer in the Dashboard Team, used by our +9,500 customers worldwide.

With a product mindset, I don't see coding as an end in itself but rather a means to bring a solution to a broader problem that needs to be solved.

You can contact me at valentin@hey.com, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valentindotxyz) or [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/valentindotxyz).

Oh and by the way, I'm also part of the [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com) Community 🏳️‍🌈.
